The table shows the findings of the amount of waste produced by different countries.

Based on the table, we can see the amount of waste increased in many countries like Japan, the US , Ireland and Poland from 1980 to 2000. The US saw a huge and dramatic climb in the amount of waste, reaching 4005 millions of tons in 2000 from 2003 millions of tons in 1980 and 3004 tons in 1990. In terms of Japan, it had an upward trend with the amount of waste increasing from 44 millions of tons in 1980 to 52 millions of tons in 2000. As for Poland, its amount of waste increased slightly from 2 millions of tons in 1980 to 5 millions of tons in 2000. Ireland had a modest rise in the amount of waste too, increasing to 3 millions of tons in 2000 from 0.2 millions of tons in 1980. 

However, Korea saw a deep decline in the waste amount, dropping to 19 millions of tons in 2000 from 31 millions of tons in 1990. Portugal leveled off at nearly 10 millions of tons from 1980 to 2000.

The three country Korea, Japan and the US were the major source of waste though Korea reduced a lot waste. What’s more, the amount of waste from America was even more than the amount that other countries combined.

Paragraph 1:

**The data in the table indicates that** many countries **experienced** an increase in the amount of waste produced between 1980 and 2000.**For instance,** the United States saw a dramatic climb in waste production, increasing from 2003 million tons in 1980 to 4005 million tons in 2000. **Similarly,** Japan's waste production increased from 44 million tons in 1980 to 52 million tons in 2000. Ireland **also** had a notable rise in waste production, increasing from 0.2 million tons in 1980 to 3 million tons in 2000, while Poland's waste production increased slightly from 2 million tons to 5 million tons **over the same period.**

Paragraph 2:

However, the data also shows that some countries experienced a decline in waste production. **For example,** Korea's waste production dropped from 31 million tons in 1990 to 19 million tons in 2000, **indicating** a positive trend towards reducing waste. Portugal's waste production remained relatively constant at around 10 million tons from 1980 to 2000.

Paragraph 3:

**It is worth noting that** the United States, Japan, and Korea were the major sources of waste production, with these three countries accounting for a significant percentage of the total waste produced worldwide. Despite Korea's reduction in waste production, the amount of waste generated by the United States was still more than all other countries combined.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the data from the table indicates that there were notable trends in waste production across different countries from 1980 to 2000. While some countries experienced a decrease in waste production, others saw a significant increase. The United States, Japan, and Korea were major contributors to worldwide waste production, indicating the need for more sustainable waste management practices to address this global issue.
